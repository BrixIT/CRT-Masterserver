# Computer Repair Toolkit server

This is the central server for use with the [Computer Repair Toolkit](https://github.com/BrixIT/CRT-Client). It a PHP webapp written with the Symfony framework.

The central server stores reports generated by the client tool and acts as a command and control server for all computers in the network running the client.

## Discovery

To use this server in the CRT client you need to press "c" in the main menu (Connect to central server). The client will try to find the central server
by using DNS Service Discovery (also called ZeroConf on windows, Bonjour on mac and Avahi on Linux).

Broadcasting the DNSSD information is not handled by this webapp. The easiest way to do this is to create the following service file for the avahi daemon in linux:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" standalone='no'?><!--*-nxml-*-->
<!DOCTYPE service-group SYSTEM "avahi-service.dtd">

<!-- See avahi.service(5) for more information about this configuration file -->

<service-group>
  <name replace-wildcards="yes">CRT Master server (%h)</name>
  <service>
    <type>_crt._tcp</type>
    <port>31337</port>
  </service>
</service-group>
```

You can save this in `/etc/avahi/services/crt.service` for example. If you restart the avahi daemon then it will start broadcasting
the CRT server on the same host on port 31337. Make sure you specify the same port here as the one in the webserver configuration for
this webapp.
